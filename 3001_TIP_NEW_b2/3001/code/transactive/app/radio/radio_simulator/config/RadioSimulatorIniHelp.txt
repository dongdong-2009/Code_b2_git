Summary
-------

Brief but useful description of the RadioSimulator ini file format



Fields
------

Name: That which is displayed in the RadioSimulator for the entry.
    Also defines the start of each entry.

Data: hex, wild card specified by '*'
    Now supports a single quoted string on a line with an optional size specifier
    eg. "123" is equivalent to 313233
    eg. "123"/5 is equivalent to 3132330000

Ivar format: <Char> : <offset (in data)> : <length> : <offset (in resp)>

Ilog format: <string with no spaces or colon> : <offset (in data)> : <length> : < h/a/n hex/ascii/numeric>

Ovar format: <Var> : <offset (in resp)> : length
How to determine what to do with generated vars??? Hardcode special symbols for now...
    'L' - length of full packet (not supported)
    'M' - length of train message (not supported)
    '#' - use custom CCIT crc16

Resp: '*' are replaced by Vars/Ovar or, if none, then Data is used to fill

RespSize: (optional) to allow zero padding of message to specified size,
    useful for sds train messages.
    [default=byte size of Resp]

Continue: (optional) only used to trigger a cascade of events matching input
    data, handy for auto sending radio control messages for train sds calls
    'YES'|'ON'  - continue executing subsequent matching UseCases
    'NO'|'OFF'  - [default] do not cascade/continue
    'FIRST'     - execute this matching UC IFF it is the FIRST match. Entries
                  so marked can be "overridden" by *earlier* defined entries
    [default=NO]

Wait: (optional) milliseconds to wait after matching, before sending response
    If there is no Data to match this still delays before sending the Resp
    [default=0]

NOTE: multiple response blocks can be specified, seperated by a "Wait" field

Verbose: can be specified between use case blocks and affects everything to
    next Verbose specification or end of file
    0 / OFF / NO - terse info
    1 / ON       - some hex dumps of received/sent messages
    2            - more detail - also show ascii'fied dumps
    [default=NO]



Command Line Arguments
----------------------

The RadioSimulator also supports a --parser-verbosity command line argument
with following possible values:

    0..9 : [default=1] Specifies verbosity as a numeric value.
    ON   : same as 9
    OFF  : same as 0

These values are currently used in the Simulator for following:
    1 : informs of errors and when processing is complete
    3 : also includes processed Name/IVar/ILog/OVar/RespSize
    5 : also includes actual line processed



Sample Entry
------------

Name = A rule name
Data = 00112233
Data = 00****33
Data = 00112233 "a string"
Data = 00112233 "a long string"/100
Ivar = X:4:4:4
Ivar = Y:8:4:8
Ilog = Xhex:4:4:h
Ilog = Xascii:4:4:a
Ilog = Xnumeric:4:4:n
Resp = DEADBEEF ******** ******** DEADBEEF
Resp = 00000000 **
Respsize = 22
Ovar = #:-2:2
Continue = YES
Wait = 500
Resp = 12
Respsize = 16
Wait = 500
