How to Install BEA Package and Misc Files in OCC Servers
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Place the Mms_Software directory, dmqsaf.jrn, dmq.ini to /u01/transactive/bin/ directory.
   - This is needed for the configuration of MMS and also for the journal file.


2. Place the .profile file in the transactive user directory (/u01/transactive/)
   - .profile file is needed for running BEA test client. Added additional path for BEADIR
     and LD_LIBRARY_PATH


3. Place the static-routes file in the /etc/init.d directory. This file is needed to add route
   permanently to MMS network. Also place the link file (S76static-route) in /etc/rc2.d directory to link to this
   file.

4. Place the tcpip_timeout file in the /etc/init.d directory. This file is needed to minimise 
   the timing of tcp/ip connection timeout when MMS server is not available. Also place the link
   file (S76tcpip_timeout) in /etc/rc2.d directory to link to the file.
