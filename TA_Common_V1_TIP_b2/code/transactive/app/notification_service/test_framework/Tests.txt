Change HOST column to SIMULATORHOST and add NOTIFICATIONHOST column.  Need to update NST_Simulator to use these.


9 consumers - all combinations of
TestCommsContext1, TestCommsContext2, *
999997,999998,*

1 supplier
TestCommsContext1, 999997


SQL query - 
all messages sent were received by relevant consumers - need to query both NST_MESSAGESSENT and NST_MESSAGESRECEIVED
all messages received have srcseqnum == expectedseqnum


Then add 2nd supplier
TestCommsContext1, 999998


Running 1 notification service on a separate host to the simulator

add additional suppliers - no consumers will receive messages from these suppliers
Entity Key != 1
Location Key != 1




TODO but later:
need to use STAF to start/stop notification services & console mgr 
rather than sql query use some sort of application that also checks other message fields
