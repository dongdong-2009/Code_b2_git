Report Manager Installation Note
--------------------------------
--------------------------------

Version:     1.03
Build Date:  24 February 2004

Release History
---------------
V1.03:
- Address issue TD1703.
Corrected problem where the message 'The table 'alarm_qry' could not be loaded' was 
displayed when attempting to display report Alarm.rpt that had a group tree on the 
left after having displayed a report that didn't have a group tree.

V1.02:
- Source code compiled whilst referencing craxdrt9.dll located in the 
cots\CrystalReports\dlls subdirectory instead of the local dlls subdirectory.

V1.01:
- Compiled source code now includes VersionGen.cpp.
- The --db-connection string now does not need to be supplied on the command line
  when launched via the Control Station. However, if it is, then the values supplied
  via the command line will override those supplied via the Control Station.
- Application window size and position is persistent between subsequent launching of 
  the application.
- This build contains the latest version of crv_dlls.zip which contains an updated 
  version of crdb_oracle.dll. This version fixes the problem where live on demand 
  data was not being displayed on the report out.

V1.00:
- First release.
